# Thesis_artifacts
This project contains all the necessary files used for the thesis outcome

## Files
- evidence_matrix.csv — Only what sources state (Unclear if not published).
- assumptions_matrix.csv — Fills only Unclear fields with sector-based assumptions (A1–A6).
- assumption_log.csv — Assumption IDs and rationale.
- source_log.csv — Paste URLs/DOIs and page/figure pointers.
- system_sheet_template.md — 1-page template per system.
- generate_figures.py — Script to make Chapter 4 & 5 figures.

## Policy
- Charts use evidence_matrix.csv only. Assumptions are discussed in text, some plotted here.
- Full assumptions graphs can be plotted(in case) using assumption_matrix.csv
- Keep matrices separate and label assumptions clearly.


## Note: 
The Plotting python notebook is used to plot figures using the values of evidence matrix. Anyone can use this file to create
figures based on there tempelate to have a visual representation of there use case. Similarly assumption plots can be done through python notebook as well
I have uploaded samples of assumptions using assumption dataset.
